## Part 2: Modeling Procedure

### Step 1: Develop Architectural Catalogs

Your task is to develop three separate architectural catalogs. For each, start by identifying high-level elements and then decompose them to a logical level of detail.

1. **Develop the Value Stream Catalog:**
   * Start with the top-level `ValueStreams` from Part 1 and decompose them into more detailed stages to create a full value stream hierarchy.

2. **Develop the Information Catalog:**
   * Identify the key `BusinessObjects` (representing the core information concepts of the business) that are critical to the sector.
   * Decompose these into a logical hierarchy.

3. **Develop the Business Capability Catalog:**
   * Identify the high-level `Capabilities` required for this sector and decompose them into a logical hierarchy.
   * **Guideline:** A capability name often combines a business object (noun) with an activity (verb), for example, "Project Management".
   * **Constraint:** Focus on **core** capabilities specific to the business model; avoid generic administrative capabilities (e.g., 'HR Management').

### Step 2: Define Architectural Mappings

Now, create mappings between the elements from the catalogs to show how they relate to each other.

1. **Define Cross-Architectural Mappings:**
   * Map `ValueStream` stages to the `Capabilities` that realize them.
   * Map `Capabilities` to the `BusinessObjects` (information concepts) they **modify**.

### Step 3: Perform Gap Analysis and Refinement

Review the mappings created in the previous step to ensure completeness and logical consistency.

1. **Identify Gaps:** Check for obvious gaps, such as a critical value stream stage that is not realized by any capability, or a core capability that does not act on any business object.
2. **Refine Catalogs:** Based on your analysis, refine the elements in the catalogs from Step 1 to resolve any identified gaps or inconsistencies. This may involve adding, renaming, or regrouping elements to improve the overall cohesion of the architecture.

### Step 4: Prepare for Final Output

1. Consolidate all final elements and relationships.
2. Assign a `Level` property to all elements based on their position in their respective hierarchies (top-level elements are Level 0, their children are Level 1, and so on).
3. Assign a `Sequence` property to the decomposed `ValueStream` elements.
