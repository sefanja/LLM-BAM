An experienced business architect reviews the validation report and identifies the logical inconsistencies in the model. The violations point to missing relationships that break the model's vertical and horizontal coherence.

*   **C4 (Upward Coherence):** Low-level relationships (e.g., between Level 2 capabilities or a Level 2 capability and a Level 1 value stream) were missing their corresponding parent-level relationships. For example, `CAP224: Inquiry & Case Management` served `VS21: Handle Inquiries & Grievances`, but the parent relationship between `CAP22: Member & Group Administration` and `VS2: Administer Member Services` was missing. These have been added.
*   **C5 (Downward Coherence):** High-level relationships were not substantiated by any relationships between their respective children. For example, `CAP2: Member Lifecycle Management` served `VS2: Administer Member Services`, but no child of `CAP2` (e.g., `CAP22`) was explicitly linked to any child of `VS2` (e.g., `VS21`). These child-level relationships have been added to ground the high-level abstractions.
*   **C6 (Capability Impact):** Several capabilities, such as `Data Governance` and `Claim Intake & Validation`, had no defined impact on any business object. Association relationships have been added to show that these capabilities create or modify specific business objects (e.g., `Claim Intake & Validation` now modifies `Claim Header` and `Claim Line`).
*   **C7 (Object Relevance):** Conversely, several business objects, like `Claim Header` and `Performance Dashboard`, were not modified by any capability, making them appear irrelevant. They have been linked to the capabilities that logically create or manage them.
*   **C8 (Capability Purpose):** A number of supporting capabilities (e.g., `Strategic Management`, `Data & Analytics Management`) were not linked to the value-creating activities they enable. Serving relationships have been added to connect these supporting capabilities to the core business capabilities they serve, ensuring all capabilities have a clear purpose tied to value delivery.
