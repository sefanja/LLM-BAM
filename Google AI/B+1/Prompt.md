```
======================================================================
          ARCHITECTURAL COHERENCE VALIDATION REPORT
======================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: FAILED

VALIDATION SUMMARY:
  - Total Violations: 29/491 (6%)
  - FAILED Rules: C4, C6, C7, C8
  - PASSED Rules: C0, C1, C2, C3, C5, C9

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 14/58 (24%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents.
 * Rationale: This ensures that low-level relationships are reflected at higher levels of abstraction.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (capability: Actuarial Risk Management) --> (value-stream: Analyze Market & Risk)
   - serving-relationship: (capability: Billing & Collections Management) --> (value-stream: Manage Premium Billing)
   - serving-relationship: (capability: Grievance & Appeals Management) --> (value-stream: Manage Appeals)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 3/36 (8%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must modify at least one business object.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every defined capability is meaningful by having a concrete impact on a business object.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Data Governance
   - capability: Product Portfolio Management
   - capability: Claim Intake & Validation

[!!] C7 - Object Relevance: 6/31 (19%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business object must be modified by at least one capability.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every business object is relevant to the organization's value-creating activities.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - business-object: Financial Transaction
   - business-object: Claim Header
   - business-object: Claim Line

[!!] C8 - Capability Purpose: 6/36 (17%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must either directly realize a value stream stage or support another capability that does.
 * Rationale: This guarantees that all potential is ultimately linked to a value-creating purpose.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Strategic Management
   - capability: Risk & Compliance Management
   - capability: Data & Analytics Management

## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, use the provided `Statement` and `Rationale` to understand the nature of the logical error.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the elements, relationships, and hierarchies in the model to resolve all identified violations. You must determine the most logical way to correct the model based on your understanding of the rules.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`).

---

### Final Output Requirements

Before generating the final CSV files, you **must** ensure the following format requirements are met:

* **Content Completeness:** The `Documentation` column for **every single element** in `elements.csv` must be filled with a concise, meaningful description.
* **Format Adherence:** The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, or `BusinessObject`.
