You are an experienced business architect. Your task is to correct an architectural model that you previously created. The model was validated against a set of formal rules, and several violations were found.

Your goal is to analyze the provided validation report, understand the root cause of each violation, and generate a **new, complete, and corrected version** of the entire architectural model that is both **formally correct** and **adheres to all output specifications**.

## The Complete Model to be Corrected

Here is the full model that contains the violations.

**`elements.csv`:**
```csv
<!-- INSERT THE COMPLETE elements.csv CONTENT FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPT HERE -->
```

**`relations.csv`:**
```csv
<!-- INSERT THE COMPLETE relations.csv CONTENT FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPT HERE -->
```

**`properties.csv`:**
```csv
<!-- INSERT THE COMPLETE properties.csv CONTENT FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPT HERE -->
```

## The Validation Report

The following violations were detected in the model provided above:

```
<!-- INSERT THE COMPLETE VALIDATION CHECKER OUTPUT HERE -->
```

## Complete Rule Definitions for Reference

To help you correct the model, here is the complete set of formal constraints. Use this list to understand any violation reported in Step 2.

### Constraints for Consistent Zooming (C1-C5)

* **(C1) Unique Parent:** Each element must have at most one parent.
* **(C2) Acyclicity:** An element cannot be its own ancestor.
* **(C3) Consistent Refinement Depth:** All hierarchies must be 'balanced'. All leaf elements (those without children) must exist at the same level of detail.
* **(C4) Upward Coherence:** A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents.
* **(C5) Downward Coherence:** A relationship between two parent elements requires that at least one pair of their respective children is also related.

### Constraints for Cross-Perspective Alignment (C6-C9)

* **(C6) Capability Impact:** Each `Capability` must modify at least one `BusinessObject`.
* **(C7) Object Relevance:** Each `BusinessObject` must be modified by at least one `Capability`.
* **(C8) Capability Purpose:** Each `Capability` must either directly realize a `ValueStream` stage or support another capability that does.
* **(C9) Traceability:** Each `ValueStream` stage must be realized by **exactly one** `Capability`.

## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate with Quality Checks

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, find the corresponding rule in the list above to understand what is wrong.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the model to fix the specific errors.
   * For **hierarchical errors (C1, C2, C3)**, you will likely need to adjust `CompositionRelationship` entries in `relations.csv` or add/remove elements to balance the hierarchy.
   * For **vertical coherence errors (C4, C5)**, you will likely need to add or remove `ServingRelationship` or `AssociationRelationship` entries at the parent or child level.
   * For **cross-perspective alignment errors (C6, C7, C8, C9)**, you will likely need to add or remove elements or relationships to ensure every element has a required connection.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`) as your final response. Do not only provide the changes; provide the complete, new model.
   * **Format Adherence:** The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may only contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, and `BusinessObject`. Do not forget to include the `Documentation` in `elements.csv`.
