## The Validation Report

The following violations were detected in the model provided above. The report includes the statement for each violated rule.

```
======================================================================
          ARCHITECTURAL COHERENCE VALIDATION REPORT
======================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: FAILED

VALIDATION SUMMARY:
  - Total Violations: 5/473 (1%)
  - FAILED Rules: C6, C9
  - PASSED Rules: C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, C8

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 2/27 (7%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must modify at least one business object.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every defined capability is meaningful by having a concrete impact on a business object.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Fraud, Waste & Abuse Management
   - capability: Medical Policy Management

[!!] C9 - Traceability: 3/32 (9%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each value stream stage must be realized by exactly one capability.
 * Rationale: This constraint ensures traceability and governability. It establishes a clear, unambiguous link from value-creating action back to the accountable capability.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Execute Sales & Onboarding
   - value-stream: Deliver Core Services
   - value-stream: Provide Member Support

## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, use the provided `Statement` and `Rationale` to understand the nature of the logical error.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the elements, relationships, and hierarchies in the model to resolve all identified violations. You must determine the most logical way to correct the model based on your understanding of the rules.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`).

---

### Final Output Requirements

Before generating the final CSV files, you **must** ensure the following format requirements are met:

* **Content Completeness:** The `Documentation` column for **every single element** in `elements.csv` must be filled with a concise, meaningful description.
* **Format Adherence:** The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, or `BusinessObject`.
