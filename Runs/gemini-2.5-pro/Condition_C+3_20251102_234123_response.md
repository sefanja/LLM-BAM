# Raw LLM Response for Condition_C+3

Here is the new, complete, and corrected version of the architectural model that resolves all listed violations.

### Analysis of Violations and Corrections

The validation report identified one violation against rule `C10 - Recursive Unique Custodianship`.

*   **Violation:** The Business Object `BO1_1` ("Health Product") has more than one custodian at the same level (Level 1).
*   **Evidence:** The original `relations.csv` file contained two `AssociationRelationship` entries targeting `BO1_1` from Level 1 Capabilities:
    1.  Source: `C1_1` ("Develop & Manage Products") -> Target: `BO1_1` ("Health Product")
    2.  Source: `C1_4` ("Deliver Core Services") -> Target: `BO1_1` ("Health Product")
*   **Rule Statement:** "For every Business Object element at an internal level (not a leaf), there must be exactly one Capability at the same level that has custodianship over it."
*   **Correction:** The capability `C1_1` ("Develop & Manage Products") is the logical sole custodian of the "Health Product" business object, as it is responsible for its design, pricing, and lifecycle. The capability `C1_4` ("Deliver Core Services") consumes or uses information about the health product to process claims but does not own the product concept itself. Therefore, the `AssociationRelationship` from `C1_4` to `BO1_1` was removed to establish unique custodianship under `C1_1`.
