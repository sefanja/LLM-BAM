                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 11/128 (8.59%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Rationale: undefined
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Impact & Dissemination Management) --> (Foster Collaborative Networks)
   - serving-relationship: (Research Financial Administration) --> (Report to Funding Body)
   - serving-relationship: (Marketing & Communications) --> (Report on Partnership Impact)

[!!] C5 - Downward Coherence: 1/49 (2.04%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A relationship between two parent elements requires that at least one pair of their respective children is also related.
 * Rationale: This ensures that high-level relationships are grounded in more detailed, concrete relations.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Venture Creation & Support) --> (Deliver & Manage Partner Value)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 5/46 (10.87%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business capability must transform exactly one business object, with one exception: at the leaf level it may transform multiple objects.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every capability has a well-defined, non-overlapping impact on value creation. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the model from having to use unnatural language not typically used by the business.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Student Lifecycle Management
   - capability: Research Development & Execution
   - capability: Commercialization & Contract Management

[!!] C7 - Object Relevance: 5/38 (13.16%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business object must be transformed by exactly one business capability, with one exception: at the leaf level, an object may be transformed by multiple capabilities.
 * Rationale: This ensures clear relevancy and accountability for the object in value-creating activities. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the modeler from having to identify overly detailed object lifecycle stages that would otherwise make the model unrecognizable.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - business-object: Program Portfolio
   - business-object: Student Record
   - business-object: Research Output

[!!] C8 - Capability Purpose: 4/46 (8.7%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must either directly realize a value stream stage or support another capability that does.
 * Rationale: This guarantees that all potential is ultimately linked to a value-creating purpose.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Opportunity Assessment
   - capability: Performance & Development
   - capability: Campus & Facilities Operations

[!!] C9 - Traceability: 3/57 (5.26%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each value stream stage must be realized by exactly one capability.
 * Rationale: This constraint ensures traceability and governability. It establishes a clear, unambiguous link from value-creating action back to the accountable capability.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Identify Funding Opportunities
   - value-stream: Execute Research & Collect Data
   - value-stream: Deliver & Manage Partner Value
