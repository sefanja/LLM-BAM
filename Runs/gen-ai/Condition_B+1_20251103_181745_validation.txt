                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 8/114 (7.02%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Rationale: undefined
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - association-relationship: (Academic Resource Planning) --> (Curriculum Specification)
   - association-relationship: (Research Infrastructure Management) --> (Physical Asset Register)
   - association-relationship: (Research Project Execution) --> (Research Dataset)

[!!] C5 - Downward Coherence: 7/58 (12.07%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A relationship between two parent elements requires that at least one pair of their respective children is also related.
 * Rationale: This ensures that high-level relationships are grounded in more detailed, concrete relations.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Human Resource Management) --> (Student Lifecycle Management)
   - serving-relationship: (Infrastructure & IT Management) --> (Student Lifecycle Management)
   - serving-relationship: (Financial Management) --> (Research Development & Execution)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 1/46 (2.17%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business capability must transform exactly one business object, with one exception: at the leaf level it may transform multiple objects.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every capability has a well-defined, non-overlapping impact on value creation. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the model from having to use unnatural language not typically used by the business.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Venture Creation & Support

[!!] C7 - Object Relevance: 2/38 (5.26%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business object must be transformed by exactly one business capability, with one exception: at the leaf level, an object may be transformed by multiple capabilities.
 * Rationale: This ensures clear relevancy and accountability for the object in value-creating activities. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the modeler from having to identify overly detailed object lifecycle stages that would otherwise make the model unrecognizable.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - business-object: Funder Profile
   - business-object: Employment Contract

[!!] C8 - Capability Purpose: 7/46 (15.22%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must either directly realize a value stream stage or support another capability that does.
 * Rationale: This guarantees that all potential is ultimately linked to a value-creating purpose.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Research Ethics & Integrity
   - capability: Alumni & Donor Relations
   - capability: Venture Creation & Support

[!!] C9 - Traceability: 15/57 (26.32%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each value stream stage must be realized by exactly one capability.
 * Rationale: This constraint ensures traceability and governability. It establishes a clear, unambiguous link from value-creating action back to the accountable capability.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Develop Educational Offerings
   - value-stream: Resource & Platform Enablement
   - value-stream: Develop Research & Innovation Portfolio
