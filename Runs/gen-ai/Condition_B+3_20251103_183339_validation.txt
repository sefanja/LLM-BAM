                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 14/130 (10.77%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Rationale: undefined
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - association-relationship: (Academic Resource Planning) --> (Curriculum Specification)
   - association-relationship: (Research Infrastructure Management) --> (Physical Asset Register)
   - association-relationship: (Proposal & Grant Management) --> (Funder Profile)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 1/46 (2.17%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business capability must transform exactly one business object, with one exception: at the leaf level it may transform multiple objects.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every capability has a well-defined, non-overlapping impact on value creation. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the model from having to use unnatural language not typically used by the business.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Financial Management

[!!] C7 - Object Relevance: 1/38 (2.63%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business object must be transformed by exactly one business capability, with one exception: at the leaf level, an object may be transformed by multiple capabilities.
 * Rationale: This ensures clear relevancy and accountability for the object in value-creating activities. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the modeler from having to identify overly detailed object lifecycle stages that would otherwise make the model unrecognizable.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - business-object: Asset Record

[!!] C8 - Capability Purpose: 2/46 (4.35%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must either directly realize a value stream stage or support another capability that does.
 * Rationale: This guarantees that all potential is ultimately linked to a value-creating purpose.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Alumni & Donor Relations
   - capability: Enterprise Systems Management

[!!] C9 - Traceability: 8/57 (14.04%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each value stream stage must be realized by exactly one capability.
 * Rationale: This constraint ensures traceability and governability. It establishes a clear, unambiguous link from value-creating action back to the accountable capability.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Prepare Learning Environments
   - value-stream: Develop Core Facilities
   - value-stream: Build Research Talent & Expertise
