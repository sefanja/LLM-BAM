## The Validation Report

The following violations were detected in the model provided above. The report includes the statement for each violated rule.

```
======================================================================
          ARCHITECTURAL COHERENCE VALIDATION REPORT
======================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: FAILED

VALIDATION SUMMARY:
  - Total Violations: 3/667 (0.45%)
  - FAILED Rules: C4, C6
  - PASSED Rules: C0, C1, C2, C3, C5, C7, C8, C9

NOTE: If C0, C1 or C2 fails, the results become unreliable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 1/96 (1.04%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Rationale: undefined
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Partner Relationship Management) --> (Grant & Proposal Development)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 2/27 (7.41%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business capability must transform exactly one business object, with one exception: at the leaf level it may transform multiple objects.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every capability has a well-defined, non-overlapping impact on value creation. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the model from having to use unnatural language not typically used by the business.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Partner Relationship Management
   - capability: Research Ethics & Compliance Management

======================================================================

## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, use the provided `Statement` and `Rationale` to understand the nature of the logical error.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the elements, relationships, and hierarchies in the model to resolve all identified violations. You must determine the most logical way to correct the model based on your understanding of the rules.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`).

---

### Final Output Requirements

Before generating the final CSV files, you **must** ensure the following format requirements are met:

* **Content Completeness:** The `Documentation` column for **every single element** in `elements.csv` must be filled with a concise, meaningful description.
* **Format Adherence:** The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, or `BusinessObject`.

```
