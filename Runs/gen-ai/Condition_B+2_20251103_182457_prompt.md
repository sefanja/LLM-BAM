          ARCHITECTURAL COHERENCE VALIDATION REPORT
======================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: FAILED

VALIDATION SUMMARY:
  - Total Violations: 40/853 (4.69%)
  - FAILED Rules: C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9
  - PASSED Rules: C0, C1, C2, C3

NOTE: If C0, C1 or C2 fails, the results become unreliable.

                   DETAILED VIOLATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C4 - Upward Coherence: 8/114 (7.02%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Rationale: undefined
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - association-relationship: (Academic Resource Planning) --> (Curriculum Specification)
   - association-relationship: (Research Infrastructure Management) --> (Physical Asset Register)
   - association-relationship: (Research Project Execution) --> (Research Dataset)

[!!] C5 - Downward Coherence: 7/58 (12.07%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A relationship between two parent elements requires that at least one pair of their respective children is also related.
 * Rationale: This ensures that high-level relationships are grounded in more detailed, concrete relations.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Human Resource Management) --> (Student Lifecycle Management)
   - serving-relationship: (Infrastructure & IT Management) --> (Student Lifecycle Management)
   - serving-relationship: (Financial Management) --> (Research Development & Execution)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 1/46 (2.17%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business capability must transform exactly one business object, with one exception: at the leaf level it may transform multiple objects.
 * Rationale: This ensures that every capability has a well-defined, non-overlapping impact on value creation. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the model from having to use unnatural language not typically used by the business.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Venture Creation & Support

[!!] C7 - Object Relevance: 2/38 (5.26%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each business object must be transformed by exactly one business capability, with one exception: at the leaf level, an object may be transformed by multiple capabilities.
 * Rationale: This ensures clear relevancy and accountability for the object in value-creating activities. The exception at the leaf-level prevents the modeler from having to identify overly detailed object lifecycle stages that would otherwise make the model unrecognizable.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - business-object: Funder Profile
   - business-object: Employment Contract

[!!] C8 - Capability Purpose: 7/46 (15.22%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each capability must either directly realize a value stream stage or support another capability that does.
 * Rationale: This guarantees that all potential is ultimately linked to a value-creating purpose.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - capability: Research Ethics & Integrity
   - capability: Alumni & Donor Relations
   - capability: Venture Creation & Support

[!!] C9 - Traceability: 15/57 (26.32%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: Each value stream stage must be realized by exactly one capability.
 * Rationale: This constraint ensures traceability and governability. It establishes a clear, unambiguous link from value-creating action back to the accountable capability.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Develop Educational Offerings
   - value-stream: Resource & Platform Enablement
   - value-stream: Develop Research & Innovation Portfolio

## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, use the provided `Statement` and `Rationale` to understand the nature of the logical error.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the elements, relationships, and hierarchies in the model to resolve all identified violations. You must determine the most logical way to correct the model based on your understanding of the rules.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`).

---

### Final Output Requirements

Before generating the final CSV files, you **must** ensure the following format requirements are met:

* **Content Completeness:** The `Documentation` column for **every single element** in `elements.csv` must be filled with a concise, meaningful description.
* **Format Adherence:** The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, or `BusinessObject`.
