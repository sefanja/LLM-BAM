## Part 4: Iterative Validation & Correction

> The model you previously generated for the 'NetNL Design Brief' contains the following [X] formal violations of architectural coherence principles:
>
> * [Violation 1: e.g., "The model is not consistently refined to two levels of detail as required."]
> * [Violation 2: e.g., "The Level 1 capability 'Customer Management' has two child elements, but the Level 1 capability 'Grid Operations' has nine, which violates the guideline for balanced decomposition."]
> * [Violation 3: e.g., "The value stream stage 'Process Request' is mapped to three capabilities instead of one primary capability."]
> * [...]
>
> Please revise the original model to correct these specific violations while preserving the original intent as much as possible.
