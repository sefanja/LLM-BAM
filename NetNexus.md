# Reference Architecture Design Brief: "NetNexus Reference Model"

## Part 1: Reference Sector Context

* **Sector Name:** Dutch Electricity & Gas Grid Operators (TSO/DSO)
* **Core Purpose & Societal Role:** To ensure the safe, reliable, and affordable transport of electricity and gas from producers to consumers. The sector's critical societal role is to maintain and operate the national energy infrastructure, which is a foundational pillar for the economy and public life. Increasingly, its role is to actively facilitate the energy transition by connecting renewable energy sources and accommodating new forms of demand.
* **Primary Business Model Archetype(s):** A hybrid model, primarily Business-to-Consumer (B2C) for household connections, Business-to-Business (B2B) for corporate connections and for services to energy suppliers/producers, and Business-to-Government (B2G) for public infrastructure coordination.
* **Key Strategic Drivers & Basis of Competition:** Competition is non-existent as the sector consists of regional monopolies. Success is driven by **Operational Excellence** (ensuring grid reliability, safety, and uptime) and **Strategic Adaptation** (effectively managing massive capital investments to facilitate the national energy transition). Performance is measured against strict regulatory targets, not against market competitors.
* **Dominant Environmental Factors:** Operates within a framework of **stringent government regulation** (by the ACM) that dictates tariffs, investment levels, and performance standards. The sector is defined by its **natural monopoly status** with a public service obligation, requiring **massive, long-term capital investments**. The overarching driver is the **national energy transition policy**, which forces a fundamental shift in infrastructure planning and operation.
